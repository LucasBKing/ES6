## Covering ES6 features

- Setting babel
- Understading hoisting: js hoists all the function and variables to the top of its declaration
- To solve hoist behavior, use let and const.
- let and const have block scope, var have function scope
- const is like let but immutable (can't be changed)
- Arrow functions
