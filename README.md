## Covering ES6 features

- Setting babel
- Understading hoisting: js hoists all the function and variables to the top of its declaration
- To solve hoist behavior, use let and const.
- let and const have block scope, var have function scope
- const is like let but immutable (can't be changed)
- Arrow functions
- Default parameters
- Rest parameters: the problem is how function arguments can be accessed. You can access it as an array, but its not exactly one. All the parameters are set to the arguments, but you can't differentiate them.
- Spread parameters: the inverse of the rest parameter, you can pass a parameter that will be assigned to the parameters of the function
